# Anti-Duplicator

This script gets the folder name as a parameter and finds duplicated files in this folder and subfolders, after that it prints the list of duplicates files with the same name and size.

# Quickstart

Example of script launch on Linux

```#!bash

$ python duplicates.py <path to directory>

For example you will see.

C:\Python\Projects\11_duplicates>duplicates.py c:\1
------------------------------
Duplicated file: true.txt with size: 0
Location is: c:\1\true.txt
Location is: c:\1\2\true.txt


```
